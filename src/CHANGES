CHANGES to make
  Possibly make all arithmetic a supertrait
  
Somehow encode the wordlength and whether or not it is utf8 into the file

Handle thread failures unstead of unwrapping

Finish Extended Precision

Parallelise reading and processing files
Parallelise writing to files

Parallelise calculating mulords (weight it by size)
  Determine the interval that would be roughly equivalent in computation
    split the interval into t sections 
    
 Priority High
   
   Handle thread errors instead of panicking
   Eliminate all panics except in initialising Compvector constructor
   Eliminate all unwraps
   
   Implement Epz
   
   Implement Pinch's algorithm for Fermat pseudoprimes
   Implement function filtering of compvectors
   Implement LucasV filtering
   
   Given some integer calculate how many liars it has.
   
 Priority Low
   Configure the Cfile to store the byte-dimension and/or utf8
 
 
 Priority Extreme
  Implement MontCore to provide montgomery arithmetic functions and routines only for the datatype
  
  Implement Natural to wrap these functions into properly branching for exponentiation
  
  Branching for exponentiation 
  
    Check the montgomery arithmetic 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Rewrite IO to reduce code duplication
 
 Implement Persistent for as many structs as possible
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Generalised Pinch Odd-only
  
    set a midway point Mp = sqrt(n)
    
    factor b^k-1 and b^k+1 to the highest practical bound B
    
     Calculate the ord(a,n) for n > B && n < Mp
         
 
   Generalised Pinch algorithm 
   
     Generalised from R.G.E. Pinch's algorithm for base-2 pseudoprimes
     
     Set a  midway point (e.g Mp = sqrt(n)
    Factor b^k-1 to the highest practical bound collect the prime factors that are greater than Mp.
    Set this bound at B.
    
    Calculate the ord_b(p) for all P < Mp
    Small factors 
    Given a p, all the possible cofactors to produce a pseudoprime are of the form x*ordb(p)+p^-1
    
    For some orders greater than B calculate b^k mod n == 1
    
    
    
    
    Heuristic value
    
    For i in witness set if i < 10000 calculate the quadratic residues
    
    calculate crt set until the residue classes are too large
    
    Parallelisation

       1. Download feitsma-Galways pseudoprime table from www.cecm.sfu.ca/Pseudoprimes/psps-below-2-to-64.txt.bz2
       2. Unzip it and copy it to the examples folder (the same as this file), without renaming it
       3. Read the source code here for an alternative, if this is too complex or the page no longer exists
       4. Comment out this panic error
       5. Execute using cargo run --release --example hashtable
       6. Wait approximately 30k seconds divided by the number of cores you have available
